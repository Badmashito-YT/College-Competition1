On 12 November 2022, my school held a coding competition (Crackerjack Programmer). I participated in it. Their were 2 questions. Our teacher told
us to solve the problems using any programming Language. Since, I was comfortable with python, so I tried to solve the problems using Python Programming Language.
At first the problems looked complicated but soon after reading it properly i got the hits(about how to approach). 
Though  my approach was naive, but at least I was happy that I was able to solve it.
After checking my papper. I found that their were some silly mistakes in my answersheet.
So, After comming back from my college I updated my Python code and improved some of the lines.
And, Also some of my friends told me to write the same code in C Language. So, after completing in Python I wrote the same code in C Language.
Thank You
