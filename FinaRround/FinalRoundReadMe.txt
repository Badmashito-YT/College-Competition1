In the first round their were at least 30 students.
Then on the final round which was held on 14 Nov 2022, their
were only 4 finalist(including me).
The competition started in 1pm and after 2.5 hours at 3:15pm
I submitted my program.
The problem was a bit critical. To solve the problem I used
List & Dictionary.
When I was solving the problem I got to knbow that 
we can't directly sort a dictionary by using sort() function.
At that time I was shocked.
